- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the Django project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Apply migrations and start the Django server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

1. Navigate to the React app directory:
    ```bash
    cd react-app
    ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
